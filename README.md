# MovieSubtitleSentimentAnalysis
it is a Sentiment Analysis mini project where i used a pretrained BERT transformer on go emotions dataset to classify emotions of each subtitle.
right now this website gives a emotionalArc overview of the subtitle movie using visualization techniques like charts,graphs,etc....
this project will be useful for movie directors,institutions who used to study how a blockbuster movie emotial flow revolve or those who needs to find patterns of movies could use this website.
the future scope is to show sentiments with each subtitle where deaf peoples could understand the emotion of dialogue in movie.
another future scope is right now i doesn't use a multilingual model but it will be possible.
